**AI & Tech Developments (Past 24 Hours as of Feb 12, 2026)**

Here's a concise, prioritized summary of the most notable AI and tech news from the last day, focusing on model releases, papers/agents, open-source projects, tools, and announcements. Market reactions and broader impacts are included where significant. Information is drawn from recent reports and discussions.

### Enterprise LLM Framework Related News (e.g., Cowork, Frontier, etc.)
- **Anthropic's Claude ecosystem impact intensifies**: Claude Opus 4.6 (with agent teams and features like Claude Cowork) continues to drive enterprise adoption and market disruption. Claude Code alone has reached a ~$2.5B annual run rate, with rapid growth in business subscriptions. This has triggered selloffs in software, brokerage, insurance, and other sectors fearing AI agent displacement of knowledge work.
- **OpenAI Codex updates and adoption**: The Codex app (multi-agent coding command center) sees ongoing momentum, with recent enhancements like persistent memory (SQLite-backed, per-project) and high developer usage. It's positioned as enterprise-grade infrastructure for agent orchestration.

### New Developments in Multi-Agent Frameworks
- **Google DeepMind Aletheia agent**: A new math research agent that iteratively generates, verifies, and revises solutions in natural language. It advances autonomous scientific reasoning and has potential for producing publishable work on open problems.
- **Google Chrome WebMCP (early preview)**: New standard (in Chrome 146) lets websites expose structured, callable tools/APIs directly to AI agents via the browser (navigator.modelContext). This reduces reliance on brittle scraping/screenshots and enables more reliable multi-agent web interactions. Joint Google-Microsoft effort.
- **Broader agentic momentum**: Discussions highlight frameworks like Hive (self-evolving topology) and ongoing shifts toward multi-agent orchestration in tools like Codex and Claude. OpenAI and Anthropic are both pushing parallel agent workflows for complex tasks.

### Security Related
- **Anthropic publishes prompt injection metrics**: Detailed failure rates for Claude agents across surfaces (e.g., constrained coding vs. GUI with extended thinking). Rates scale with persistence (up to 78%+ in some scenarios without safeguards). This transparency is a win for enterprise security teams evaluating AI risks.
- **Miko AI toy data exposure**: Senators flagged an unsecured database exposing thousands of audio responses/conversations from AI toys interacting with children (dating back to Dec 2025). Raises major privacy and child safety concerns.
- **AI-generated malware reports**: Emerging cases of AI-assisted exploits (e.g., targeting vulnerabilities like React2Shell), highlighting growing attacker use of generative tools.

### Usage of Blockchain for Gen AI
No major announcements or developments reported in the past 24 hours.

### Everything Else
- **Latam-GPT open-source model launch buzz**: Chile-led regional LLM (developed with 15+ Latin American countries) officially highlighted for its focus on local languages, cultures, and data to reduce English/global-north bias. Open-source effort coordinated by CENIA aims to boost regional AI sovereignty.
- **Massive AI infrastructure spend**: Big Tech (Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Oracle) plans ~$660–690B in 2026 capex, mostly for AI data centers and compute—nearly double prior levels. Signals confidence in long-term ROI despite near-term market jitters.
- **Market volatility from AI disruption fears**: Stocks in software, logistics, property services, finance, and more faced selloffs as investors reassessed AI agent threats to traditional business models. Counterbalanced by strength in AI enablers (e.g., Nvidia, TSMC).
- **Other notable mentions**: Andrej Karpathy shared a minimal GPT implementation in 243 lines of pure Python (educational "art project"). Dario Amodei (Anthropic) discussed model consciousness and near-term AI scenarios in a high-profile interview. AI staffer exits with public warnings continued to surface.

**Overall vibe**: Agentic AI (multi-agent systems, coding agents, web-native agents) dominates the conversation, driving both excitement over capabilities and anxiety over disruption. Open-source regional efforts and security transparency are positive counterpoints. Expect continued volatility as enterprises scale these tools.
