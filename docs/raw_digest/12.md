**Past 24 hours AI & Tech summary (as of February 10, 2026)**

No major new frontier model releases (e.g., Claude Opus 4.6 or GPT-5.3-Codex arrived earlier in the week) occurred in the strict past day, but several notable enterprise, open-source, security, and research developments emerged. Here's a curated, digestible overview prioritizing model-related work, papers, and projects.

### 1. Enterprise LLM framework related news (Cowork, Frontier etc.)
- **IBM launches next-gen FlashSystem storage portfolio powered by agentic AI** — New models (5600, 7600, 9600) integrate autonomous AI agents as "co-administrators" for storage arrays. Features include self-improving operations, ransomware detection in under 1 minute, autonomous threat analysis, and customized recovery—potentially cutting manual storage management by up to 90%. This strengthens enterprise data infrastructure resilience.

### 2. New developments in multi-agent frameworks
Activity was relatively quiet in the past 24 hours for dedicated multi-agent announcements. IBM's agentic AI in FlashSystem involves autonomous agents for ongoing threat monitoring and recovery workflows, which aligns with agentic/multi-agent patterns in enterprise settings (though not a pure research framework release).

### 3. Security related
- **RSAC releases Quantickle, an open-source threat intelligence visualization tool** — A browser-based tool from RSA Conference Labs for creating visual representations of threat research. Aimed at security teams; available on GitHub (RSAC-Labs/Quantickle).
- **IBM FlashSystem agentic AI enhancements** — Includes rapid ransomware detection (<1 min) via AI trained on billions of telemetry points, plus autonomous analysis and recovery recommendations. Part of the broader enterprise storage launch.

### Everything else
- **Chile launches Latam-GPT, a new open-source LLM for Latin America** — The first major open-source language model trained specifically on diverse Latin American cultural and linguistic data (millions of regional data points across 8+ countries, led by Chile's CENIA with 30+ institutions). Aims to reduce US-centric biases in existing models like ChatGPT; open architecture for customization. Low development cost (~$550K) and collaborative regional effort.

- **New AI research papers on arXiv (Feb 10 submissions)** — Dozens of fresh papers, with notable ones including:
    - *iGRPO: Self-Feedback-Driven LLM Reasoning* — Explores improved self-feedback mechanisms for better LLM reasoning capabilities.
    - *MOVA: Towards Scalable and Synchronized Video-Audio Generation* — Advances in multimodal (video + audio) generation.
    - *Modality Gap-Driven Subspace Alignment Training Paradigm For Multimodal Large Language Models* — New training approach for multimodal LLMs.
    - Other topics: LLM-FSM for finite-state reasoning in RTL code generation, and various efficiency/alignment papers. Check arXiv cs.AI recent listings for full set.

- **Euna Solutions releases "State of AI in the Public Sector" report** — Highlights measurable value from AI in government agencies, concentrated in operational areas like procurement, budgeting, grants, and payments. Focuses on responsible, scalable adoption.

- **Kennesaw State University (Georgia) to launch Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence** — First such program in the state, starting Fall 2026, with hands-on curriculum and industry ties to meet growing AI talent demand.

**Overall note**: The past day was lighter on explosive releases compared to earlier in the week (e.g., major coding/agentic model upgrades), but featured practical enterprise/security advancements and an important regional open-source milestone. Market reactions to recent agentic/Cowork developments continued to ripple (e.g., software stock volatility), but no new direct announcements there today.
