**Past 24 Hours in AI & Tech (Feb 13–14, 2026)**

Here's a curated, digestible roundup of the biggest developments, prioritized by model releases, new papers, and open-source projects. Sourced from web searches, official announcements, and recent reports.

### Enterprise LLM Framework Related News
- **OpenAI retires legacy models and updates GPT-5.2 Instant** (Feb 13)  
  OpenAI pulled GPT-4o, GPT-4.1 series, o4-mini, and older GPT-5 variants from ChatGPT (no API changes yet). It rolled out an update to GPT-5.2 Instant for improved response style, quality, and efficiency. This pushes enterprises toward newer, more capable models while cleaning up the lineup.

- **MiniMax launches M2.5 & M2.5 Lightning** (open-sourced Feb 13, live Feb 12)  
  Chinese startup MiniMax dropped a new open-weight Mixture-of-Experts model family that rivals Claude Opus 4.6 on coding, agentic tasks, and search—at ~1/20th the cost. Enterprises can run persistent agents for ~$10k/year. Weights are open; it's positioned as a "full-stack AI employee" for real-world productivity.

### New Developments in Multi-Agent Frameworks
- **Chinese models double down on agentic capabilities**  
  MiniMax M2.5, Zhipu GLM-5, and ByteDance’s new Doubao 2.0 (released today) all ship native agent tools for long-running, multi-step tasks. ByteDance claims Doubao 2.0 matches GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro on deep reasoning and tool use. This reflects a broader shift toward production-grade agent orchestration in open/affordable models.

**New Papers & Research**
- **OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 discovers new physics result** (preprint Feb 13)  
  The model proposed a compact formula for gluon tree amplitudes (previously thought impossible at tree level). Human researchers proved it and verified independently. Shows frontier models contributing to fundamental science.

- **Meta’s FERRET red-teaming paper** (Feb 13)  
  Detailed framework for scalable, automated safety testing of LLMs (see Security section above).

**Other Notable Mentions**
- Ongoing flood of affordable Chinese open models (MiniMax, Zhipu, Alibaba) continues to pressure Western pricing and capabilities.
- No major regulatory, blockchain-GenAI, or new multi-agent *framework* drops in the last 24 hours—just model-level agentic upgrades.

The pace remains blistering, especially in China. Check back tomorrow—Spring Festival releases are just getting started. 🚀
