### Model Releases

- **MiniCPM-o 4.5**: OpenBMB released the first open-source full-duplex omni-modal LLM capable of simultaneous seeing, listening, and speaking in real-time conversations. It outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Pro on vision-language tasks with 9B parameters, supports proactive interactions like reminders, and runs on consumer PCs. Scored 77.6 on OpenCompass.

- **ACE-Step-v1.5 (2B)**: A new open-source music generation AI model that runs locally in ComfyUI, requiring only ~4GB VRAM. It outperforms Suno in quality, generates music in 8 seconds, supports LoRA fine-tuning, and is MIT-licensed for commercial use. Source: https://x.com/NerdyRodent/status/2018800746373038533

- **Qwen3-Coder-Next**: Alibaba's open-weight language model for coding agents and local development, with 80B total params but only 3B active for efficiency. Trained on 800K verifiable tasks in executable environments, it matches Sonnet 4.5 performance and supports tools like OpenClaw, Qwen Code, and web dev. Available on Hugging Face and ModelScope.

- **Kimi K2.5**: Moonshot AI's trillion-parameter open-source multimodal model, trained from scratch on text, image, and video. Achieves SOTA on 80+ tasks (e.g., 96% on AIME 2025, 87% on GPQA-Diamond). Includes Agent Swarm for parallel agent orchestration, reducing latency by up to 4.5x and boosting accuracy 6-18 points over single-agent setups. Full checkpoints released.

### New Papers

- **Self-Improving Pretraining (Meta AI)**: Introduces a method using post-trained judge models to guide pretraining for safer, more factual LLMs. Generates and evaluates multiple continuations per document chunk with RL, improving factuality by 36.2% and safety by 18.5% over standard pretraining. Helps models handle messy data from the start. Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21343

- **AGI as Collective Intelligence (Google DeepMind)**: Argues AGI may emerge from networks of specialized AI agents rather than a single system. Proposes safety focus on systems (e.g., agent markets, audits, incentives) to manage emergent behaviors and risks from coordination.
